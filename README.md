# LabVIEW-libsvm
A LabVIEW wrapper for libsvm (320) and liblinear (1.19).
It can currently be considered experimental, as it has not been extensively tested.

The easiest way to install the library is through the VIPM package.
This installs both the VIs and binary components to vi.lib.
Currently the only supported system is windows, but unix support will be added shortly.

The precompiled binaries are compiled using VS2013.
