## TODOs (not in any particular order)
1.	Redirect stdout and stderr, used in libsvm, to a file (using freopen("file.txt","w",stdout/stderr)) or user event.
2.	Make the print function user events per-instance
3.	Implement file saving/loading using the libsvm interface for portability
4.	Implement user-friendly precomputed kernels (in LabVIEW)
5a.	Make an object-oriented interface in LabVIEW.
5b.	Encapsulate the svm_problem / linear_problem in a DVR to avoid data duplication, might be necessary for huge datasets.
